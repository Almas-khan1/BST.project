# BST.project
implemented a dynamic Binary Search Tree in C++ with graphical visualization via SFML and integrated a quiz to reinforce DSA concepts.
⭐ Binary Tree Visualization in C++ with SFML
This project is a simple yet effective console and graphical application built using C++ and SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library). It provides a visualization of a Binary Search Tree (BST) along with traversal operations and an interactive quiz to test basic binary tree knowledge.

***Features
✅ Insert and delete nodes from the BST

✅ Perform inorder, preorder, and postorder traversals

✅ Visual representation of the BST using SFML graphics

✅ Interactive console-based quiz for learning and revision

✅ User-friendly menu-driven interface

***Technologies Used
C++

SFML (Simple and Fast Multimedia Library)

Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Data Structures (Binary Trees)

***Visualization
The application uses circles and lines to represent nodes and connections:

Nodes are drawn as cyan circles

Node values are shown using text

Tree structure is auto-positioned using basic coordinate math

Tree updates in real-time after insertions/deletions

✨ Make sure you have the arial.ttf font file in the same directory as your executable.

***Quiz Function
An educational binary tree quiz is built-in to test the user’s understanding:

5 multiple choice questions

Instant score and feedback based on your answers

***How to Run
Install SFML
Make sure SFML is correctly set up in your compiler (e.g., Code::Blocks, Visual Studio, etc.).
